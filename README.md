## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### What I learned

React has not scoped css styles. For that reason you should use styled components or a css framework to create component classes.

That a build react app cant be hostet with the default settings of the vscode plugin live-server. You should use serve in the terminal instead. Also to host the app on github pages follow this article
[How to host react app on github pages](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f).
